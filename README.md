This directory contains the supplementary data and files for the article, "PACA: An accessible solution for paleocoordinate calculation". Specifically:

* test_dataset.xslx: This directory contains the complete test dataset used for our study's validation. It contains 30 fossil sites with present-day coordinates, globally distributed and spanning a wide range of geological ages.

* static_benchmark_output.csv: This is the static benchmark output described in the "4.2.	Reproducibility and Long-Term Stability" section of our article. It contains the corresponding paleocoordinate outputs of the test dataset generated by this specific version of PACA (v1.0).  You can use it to compare against your own experimental runs.

* validation_references.docx: This Word document (.docx) provides a detailed bibliography of the test dataset, referencing the original sources of the data.

* user_guide.pdf: This PDF contains a comprehensive user guide with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to use Paleocoordinates Calculator.
